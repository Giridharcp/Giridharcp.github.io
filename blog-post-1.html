<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv jj hx jk hz jl ib jm id jn if" data-selectable-paragraph="">The laws of power, and how you can use them to gain power for yourself.</p>

<h2 class="jt ix eq bh bg fj ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke" data-selectable-paragraph="">Law 1: Never Outshine The Master</h2>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv jj hx jk hz jl ib jm id jn if" data-selectable-paragraph="">Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite &mdash; inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.</p>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Keys To Power</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy and other manifestations of insecurity. That is to be expected.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">While you cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others, with those above you, you must take a different approach.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is a deadly but common misconception to believe that by displaying and vaunting your gifts and talents, you are winning the master&rsquo;s affection.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">He may feign appreciation, but at this first opportunity he will replace you with someone less intelligent, attractive and threatening.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are 2 rules you must realize.</p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">1:</strong>&nbsp;You can inadvertently outshine a master simply by being yourself.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">2:</strong>&nbsp;There are masters who are more insecure than others, and you may naturally outshine them by your charm and grace.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you cannot help being charming or superior, you must learn to avoid such monsters of vanity. Or find a way to mute your good qualities when in the presence of such.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do anything you want. Entire books could be written about favourites who fell out of favour by taking their status for granted.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Turn this Law to your advantage by flattering and puffing up your master. Use discreet flattery, for e.g make him appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem like you need his expertise.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">If your ideas are more creative than your master&rsquo;s, ascribe them to him, in as public a manner as possible.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain in control, instead of being a victim to their insecurity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Reversal</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you must be selectively cruel.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing to fear from outshining him. Outdo, outcharm and outsmart him at key moments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="jt ix eq bh bg fj ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke" data-selectable-paragraph="">Law 2: Never Put Too Much Trust In Friends, Learn How To Use Enemies</h2>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv jj hx jk hz jl ib jm id jn if" data-selectable-paragraph="">Be wary of friends &mdash; they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.</p>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Keys To Power</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the harshness.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The problem is you often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each other&rsquo;s jokes.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities he/she has kept hidden.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The receipt of a favour can become oppressive &mdash; it means you have been chosen because you are a friend, not because you are deserving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring a friend that afflicts them. The more favours and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">If you never expect gratitude from a friend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove grateful.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and in the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly feelings.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Keep friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Your enemies are an untapped gold mine that you must learn to exploit.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lincoln said: &ldquo;You destroy an enemy when you make a friend of him.&rdquo;</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels sharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument for your side than all the words you could possibly put together. (Read&nbsp;<a class="aq cc kn ko kp kq" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingroups_and_outgroups">In-group, out-group</a>)</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to enhance his reputation as a surefooted fighter who can be relied upon in times of uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Reversal</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">There are times when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">A man of power often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the sake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for him; friends often do this the best, since their affection for him makes them willing to take chances.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">If your plans go awry for some reason, you can use a friend as a convenient scapegoat.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="jt ix eq bh bg fj ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke" data-selectable-paragraph="">Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions</h2>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv jj hx jk hz jl ib jm id jn if" data-selectable-paragraph="">Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelope them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.</p>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Part 1: Use decoyed objects of desire and red herrings to throw people off the scent</strong></p>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph="">If at any point in the deception you practice people have the slightest suspicion as to your intentions, all is lost. Do not give them the chance to sense what you are up to: throw them off the scent by dragging red herrings across the path. Use false sincerity, send ambiguous signals, set up misleading objects of desire. Unable to distinguish the genuine from the false, they cannot pick out your real goal.</p>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Keys To Power</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Most people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opinions at every opportunity and constantly reveal their plans and intentions.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is easy and natural to always want to talk about one&rsquo;s feelings and plans for the future, but it takes effort to control your tongue and monitor what you reveal.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Many believe that by being honest and open they are winning people&rsquo;s hearts and showing their good nature. They are wrong. Honesty bloodies more than it cuts.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">By making yourself so predictable and familiar, it becomes almost impossible to respect or fear you, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Lay honesty aside, and train yourself in the art of concealing your intentions.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Basic to an ability to conceal one&rsquo;s intentions is a simple truth about human nature &mdash; our first instinct is to always trust appearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and hear &mdash; constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else would exhaust and terrify us.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments. Most people will believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to play so lightly with something as emotional as one&rsquo;s opinions and values.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false sincerity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is important to not go too far in this area. Appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it is.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">To make your false sincerity believable, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrightness as important social values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought &mdash; though only one that is meaningless or irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Part 2: Use smoke screens to disguise your actions</strong></p>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph="">Deception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a screen of smoke to distract people&rsquo;s attention from your real purpose. The bland exterior &mdash; like the unreadable poker face &mdash; is often the perfect smoke screen, hiding your intentions behind the comfortable and familiar. If you lead the sucker down a familiar path, he won&rsquo;t catch on when you lead him into a trap.</p>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Keys To Power</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The best deceivers use a bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themselves. They know that extravagant words and gestures immediately raise suspicion.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">People can only focus on one thing at a time. It is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless person they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The simplest form of smokescreen is facial expression.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">One of the most effective smokescreen is the noble gesture. People want to believe noble gestures are genuine, for the belief is pleasant.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another effective smokescreen is the pattern, the establishment of a series of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the same way.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another psychological weakness to construct a smokescreen &mdash; if someone seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be real.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Reversal</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">No smokescreen, red herring etc. will succeed in concealing your intentions if you already have an established reputation for deception.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">In such cases, it is better to own up, to appear the honest rogue, or the repentant rogue.</li>

<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv jj hx jk hz jl ib jm id jn if" data-selectable-paragraph="">Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable.

<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a source of happiness &mdash; and you make it seem less enviable.

<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv jj hx jk hz jl ib jm id jn if" data-selectable-paragraph="">The moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of victory, arrogance and overconfidence can push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you defeat.

<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv jj hx jk hz jl ib jm id jn if" data-selectable-paragraph="">By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything changes.</p>
<p class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="hu ig">Keys To Power</strong></p>
<ul class="">
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv hw hx hy hz ia ib ic id ie if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The powerful are often people who in their youth have shown immense creativity in expressing something new through a new form. Society grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort of newness.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The problem comes later when they often grow conservative and possessive.

<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The formlessness of power is more like that of water, taking the form of whatever is around it.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Human creations evolve towards abstraction, toward being mental and less material.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">In evolution, largeness is often the first step towards extinction. What is immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly feed itself. The unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size connotes power, the bigger the better.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out the laws that others preach, the books they write to tell you what to do, and the sage advice of the elder.</li>
<li class="hs ht eq bh hu b hv ki hx kj hz kk ib kl id km if kf kg kh" data-selectable-paragraph="">Rely too much on other people&rsquo;s ideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much respect for other people&rsquo;s wisdom will make you depreciate your own.</li>
